      |           Project Title: Explainable deep learning visualization
      br
      |           Principal Investigator: Ben Hu, Ph.D.
      br
      br
      |           Introduction
    br
    |           You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by a research team from Texas
    |           A&amp;M University. The information in this form is provided to help you decide whether or not to
    |           take part. If you decide you do not want to participate, there will be no penalty to you, and you
    |           will not lose any benefits you normally would have.
    br
    br
    b Why Is This Study Being Done?
    br
    |           The purpose of this study how well different interface designs and models explain data analytics systems used for data analysis.
    br
    br
    b Why Am I Being Asked To Be In This Study?
    br
    |           Participants are needed to help us learn about data analysis software and interfaces. You are
    |           being asked to be in this study because you expressed interest in participation by looking at the
    |           advertisement in Mechanical Turk.
    br
    br
    b What Are the Alternatives to being in this study?
    br
    |           The alternative to being in the study is not to participate.
    br
    br
    b What Will I Be Asked To Do In This Study?
    br
    |           The duration of this study is up to one hour. You will be asked to complete a background 
    |           questionnaire about yourself. We will then explain a data analysis activity and demonstrate how
    |           to use the analysis software. Next, you will conduct a data analysis session and we will collect
    |           the results of your analysis. Lastly, we will ask questions about your approach and experience in
    |           a questionnaire.
    br
    br
    b Are There Any Risks To Me?
    br
    |           The risks associated with this study are minimal, and are not greater than risks ordinarily
    |           encountered with daily computer use. You do not have to answer anything you do not want to,
    |           and you can stop at any time without penalty. We are using audio and video recording to study
    |           how you use the software; this data will not be shared outside of the research team, and it will be
    |           destroyed when the research project is concluded. The recorded results of your use with the
    |           software during the analysis activity will be saved and made publicly available online, but this
    |           data will not include any of your personal information. No photos, audio recordings, or video
    |           recordings of you will be shared.
    br
    br
    b Will There Be Any Costs To Me?
    br
    |           Aside from your time; there are no costs for taking part in the study.
    br
    br
    b Will I Be Paid To Be In This Study?
    |           Yes. You will be paid up to $10.00 of compensation if it takes one hour to complete the study.
    br
    br
    b Who will know about my participation in this research study?
    br
    |           Information about you will be kept confidential and not shared with others. Only the approved
    |           members of the research team will have access to the information collected during your
    |           participation. In addition, representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human
    |           Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&amp;M University Human Subjects
    |           Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and
    |           that information is collected and secured properly.
    br
    |           This is a Department of Defense Funded effort, and as such, protocol information including
    |           information about participant health, especially in case of injury or reports of non-compliance,
    |           will be shared with Department of the Navy Human Research Protection Program (DON-HRP)
    |           and SSC-Pacific Human Research Protection Office (SSCPAC HRPO). Don-HRPP and SSC
    |           Pacific HRPO have regulatory oversight responsibilities that require them to ensure that funded
    |           research is being conducted in accordance with Federal/DoD policy and that rights of the subject
    |           are being protected, and as such, the PI will share information with these entities, if requested.
    |           Information about you will not be shared with others.
    br
    br
    b Whom do I contact with questions about the research?
    br
    |           If you have questions regarding this study, you may contact the Principal Investigator (PI) of the
    |           study, Xia &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; Hu (hu@cse.tamu.edu) or the study contact, Sina Mohseni (sina.mohseni@tamu.edu).
    br
    br
    b Whom do I contact about my rights as a research participant?
    br
    |           For questions about your rights as a research participant; or if you have questions, complaints, or
    |           concerns about the research, you may contact the Texas A&amp;M University Human Subjects
    |           Protection Program at 979.458.4067, toll-free at 1.855.795.8636, or email at irb@tamu.edu
