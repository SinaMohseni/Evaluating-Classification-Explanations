          Project Title: Explainable deep learning visualization
          </br>
          Principal Investigator: Eric Ragan, PhD
          </br>
          </br>
          Introduction</b>
          </br>
          You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by a research team from Texas
          A&M University. The information in this form is provided to help you decide whether or not to
          take part. If you decide you do not want to participate, there will be no penalty to you, and you
          will not lose any benefits you normally would have.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Why Is This Study Being Done?</b>
          </br>
          The purpose of this study how well different interface designs and models explain data
          analytics systems used for data analysis.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Why Am I Being Asked To Be In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          Participants are needed to help us learn about data analysis software and interfaces. You are
          being asked to be in this study because you expressed interest in participation.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>How Many People Will Be Asked To Be In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          Up to 1000 people may be contacted about participating.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>What Are the Alternatives to being in this study?</b>
          </br>
          The alternative to being in the study is not to participate.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>What Will I Be Asked To Do In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          The duration of this study is up to one hour. You will be asked to complete a background
          questionnaire about yourself. We will then explain a data analysis activity and demonstrate how
          to use the analysis software. Next, you will conduct a data analysis session while we use video
          and audio recording to collect data on how you use the software. Lastly, we will interview you to
          ask questions about your approach and experience.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Are There Any Risks To Me?</b>
          </br>
          The risks associated with this study are minimal, and are not greater than risks ordinarily
          encountered with daily computer use. You do not have to answer anything you do not want to,
          and you can stop at any time without penalty. We are using audio and video recording to study
          how you use the software; this data will not be shared outside of the research team, and it will be
          destroyed when the research project is concluded. The recorded results of your use with the
          software during the analysis activity will be saved and made publicly available online, but this
          data will not include any of your personal information. No photos, audio recordings, or video
          recordings of you will be shared.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Will There Be Any Costs To Me?</b></br>
          Aside from your time; there are no costs for taking part in the study.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Will I Be Paid To Be In This Study?</b>
          Participation is voluntary and no compensation will be given.
          </br></br>
          <b>Who will know about my participation in this research study?</b></br>
          Information about you will be kept confidential and not shared with others. Only the approved
          members of the research team will have access to the information collected during your
          participation. In addition, representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human
          Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&M University Human Subjects
          Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and
          that information is collected and secured properly.
          </br></br>
          <b>Whom do I contact with questions about the research?</b></br>
